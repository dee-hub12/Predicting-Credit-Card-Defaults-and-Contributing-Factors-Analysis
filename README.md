# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project focuses on predicting credit card defaults using machine learning techniques. By analyzing demographic factors, credit data, and payment history, we aim to build a robust model that accurately identifies clients at risk of defaulting on their credit card payments. The project also explores the key contributing factors to defaults and proposes risk mitigation strategies. The goal is to assist lending institutions in minimizing financial risks and enhancing credit risk management.
